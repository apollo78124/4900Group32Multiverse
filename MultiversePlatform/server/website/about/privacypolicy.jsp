<p><b>Multiverse Privacy Policy</b></p>

<p>The Multiverse Network, Inc. ("Multiverse") knows that you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously.  Please read the following to learn more about our privacy policy.  By accessing the Multiverse website, you are accepting the practices outlined in this Privacy Statement.</p> 

<p><b>What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?</b></p>

<p>This Privacy Policy covers Multiverse's treatment of personal information that Multiverse gathers when you are on the Multiverse website and when you use Multiverse services.</p>

<p>This policy does not apply to the practices of third parties that Multiverse does not own or control, or to individuals that Multiverse does not employ or manage.</p>

<p><b>What Personal Information About Customers Does Multiverse Collect?</b></p>

<p>Our primary goal in collecting personal information is to provide you with a friendly, customized, and efficient experience.  We collect the following types of information from our customers:</p>

<p><b>Information You Provide to Us:</b></p>
<p>We receive and store any information you enter on our website or provide to us in any other way. You can choose not to provide us with certain information, but then you may not be able to take advantage of many of our special features.  The personal information you provide is used for such purposes as responding to your requests for certain products and services, customizing the advertising and content you see, and communicating with you about specials and new products.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Registration:</b> In order for you to use our service, you must complete a registration form.  We require your contact information (such as name and email address).  We may also request demographic information and unique identifiers in order to provide you with a more personalized service.
<li><b>Ordering:</b> To use those services for which we charge a fee, we will also require contact information (such as billing address) and financial information.  This information is used for billing purposes.
</ul>

<p><b>Automatic Information:</b></p>

<ul>
<li>We receive and store certain types of information whenever you interact with us via our website or the Multiverse Client.  Multiverse automatically receives and records certain "traffic data" on our server logs including your IP address, Multiverse cookie information,  the page you requested, and your communications and interactions with other service registrants.  Multiverse uses this traffic data to help diagnose problems with its server, analyze trends and administer the service.
<li>The Multiverse service automatically collects usage information, such as the numbers and frequency of visitors to our site and use of the service components, similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show.  This data is only used in the aggregate.  This type of collective data enables us to figure out how often customers use parts of the service, so we can make the service appealing to as many customers as possible.  In addition, we may provide statistical information to our partners about how our customers, collectively, use our service.   We share this type of statistical data so that our partners also understand how often people use their areas and our service, so that they, too, may provide you with an optimal experience.
<li>We also collect and use information for internal purposes.  For example, if you are a registered user of the Multiverse services, we may keep records in your account history of your complaints about other registered users online behavior, and any reported violation of our Terms of Use that you or someone on your account may have committed.
<li>Many companies offer programs that help you to visit web sites anonymously.  While Multiverse will not be able to provide you with a personalized experience if we cannot recognize you, we want you to be aware that these programs are available.
</ul>

<p><b>E-mail Communications:</b></p>
<p>We may receive a confirmation when you open an e-mail from Multiverse if your computer supports this type of program, in order to help us make e-mails more interesting and helpful. We also send out emails with news or promotions.  If you are a registered user of the Mulitverse services and do not want to receive e-mail from us, please make sure you have unselected this option in your user account settings.</p>

<p><b>Information From Other Sources:</b></p>
<p>For purposes such as improving personalization of our service, we may receive information about you from other sources and add it to our account information.  We also sometimes receive updated delivery and address information from our shippers or other sources so that we can correct our records and deliver your next purchase or communication more easily.</p>

<p><b>What about Cookies?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Cookies are alphanumeric identifiers that we transfer to your computer's hard drive through your Web browser to enable our systems to recognize your browser and tell us how and when pages in our site are visited and by how many people.  Multiverse cookies do not collect personal information, and we do not combine information collected through cookies with other personal information to tell us who you are or what your account name or email address is.
<li>The "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies.  We strongly recommend that you leave the cookies activated, however, because cookies enable you to take advantage of some of Multiverse's most attractive features.
<li>Some of our business partners may use cookies on our site (for example, advertisers).  However, we have no access to or control over these cookies.
</ul>

<p><b>Will Multiverse Share Any of the Information it Receives?</b></p>
<p>Information about our customers is an integral part of our business.  We neither rent nor sell your personal information to anyone.  We share your personal information only with the entities that are controlled by or control Multiverse and as described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Affiliated Business We Do Not Control:</b><br>

We are affiliated with a variety of businesses and work closely with them.  In certain situations, these businesses operate virtual worlds within the Multiverse service or sell items to you within the  Multiverse service.  In other situations, Multiverse provides services, or sells products jointly with affiliated businesses.  You can easily recognize when an affiliated business is associated with your transaction, and we will share customer information that is related to such transactions with that affiliated business.
<li><b>Agents:</b><br>
We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you.  Examples may include fulfilling orders, delivering packages, sending postal mail and e-mail, removing repetitive information from customer lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, processing credit card payments, and providing customer service.  We may also provide your personal information to agents who will use it to verify aggregate usage data that we provide to our partners.
<li><b>Promotional Offers:</b><br>
We may send offers to certain customers on behalf of other businesses.  However, when we do so, we do not give the other business your name and address.  If you are a registered user of the Multiverse services and do not wish to receive these offers, please make sure you have unselected this option in your user account settings.
<li><b>Business Transfers:</b><br>
In some cases, we may choose to buy or sell assets or businesses.  In these types of transactions, customer information is typically one of the business assets that are transferred.  Moreover, if Multiverse, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, customer information would be one of the assets that are transferred.
<li><b>Protection of Multiverse and Others:</b><br>
We may release personal information when we believe in good faith that release is necessary to comply with that law; enforce or apply our conditions of use and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Multiverse, our employees, our users, or others.  This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
<li><b>With Your Consent:</b><br>
Except as set forth above, you will be notified when your personal information may be shared with third parties.
</ul>

<p><b>Is Information About Me Secure?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>Your Multiverse Account Information is protected by a password for your privacy and security.  You need to work to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computer by signing off once you have finished using a shared computer.
<li>Only employees who need personal information to perform a specific job (for example, a customer service representative) are granted access to it.  All of our employees are kept up to date on our privacy and security practices.
</ul>

<p><b>What Information Can I Access?</b></p>
<p>You can access your personal information on our site and correct, amend, or delete information that is inaccurate.</p>

<p><b>What Choices Do I Have?</b></p>

<ul>
<li>As stated previously, you can always opt not to disclose information, even though it may be needed to make a purchase or take advantage of certain Multiverse features.
<li>You are able to add or update certain information on pages, such as those listed in the "What Information Do I Have" section above.  When you update information, however, we often maintain a copy of the unrevised information in our records.
<li>If you are a register user of the Multiverse services, you may request deletion of your Multiverse account by logging in to your account and selecting the "delete account" option.  Please note that some information may remain in our records after deletion of your account.
<li>If you are a registered user of the Multiverse services and do not wish to receive e-mail or other mail from us, please make sure you have unselected this option in your user account settings.  Please note that if you do not want to receive legal notices from us, such as this Privacy Policy, those legal notices will still govern your use of the Multiverse web site, and you are responsible for reviewing such legal notices for changes.
<li>As explained earlier, the "help" portion of the toolbar on the majority of browsers will direct you on how to prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to command the browser to tell you when you receive a new cookie, or how to fully disable cookies. Please note, however, that if you do not enable cookies, you will not be able to take advantage of some of our attractive features.
</ul>
