<!-- BODY TEXT STARTS HERE -->

<p><b>1. ACCEPTANCE OF TERMS</b></p>
<p>The services available at multiverse.net and all linked pages ("Site") and virtual worlds owned or  operated by The Multiverse Network, Inc. ("Multiverse"), a Delaware corporation, may be accessed by you only subject to the Terms of Use described below ("Terms of Use").</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THE SERVICES (AS DEFINED BELOW).  BY ACCESSING THIS SITE OR USING ANY PART OF THE SITE OR ANY CONTENT (AS DEFINED BELOW) OR SERVICES, YOU AGREE TO BECOME BOUND BY THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS.  IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO ALL THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, THEN YOU MAY NOT ACCESS THE SITE OR USE THE CONTENT OR ANY SERVICES IN THE SITE.  MULTIVERSE’S ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY CONDITIONED UPON YOUR ASSENT TO ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS, TO THE EXCLUSION OF ALL OTHER TERMS; IF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS ARE CONSIDERED AN OFFER BY MULTIVERSE, ACCEPTANCE IS EXPRESSLY LIMITED TO THESE TERMS.</p>

<p><b>MODIFICATIONS OF TERMS OF USE</b></p>

<p>Multiverse reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace the Terms of Use at any time.  If the alterations constitute a material change to the Terms of Use, Multiverse will notify you via email.  What constitutes a "material change" will be determined at Multiverse's sole discretion, in good faith and using common sense and reasonable judgment.  You shall be responsible for regularly reviewing these terms and becoming familiar with any such modifications.  Your use of the Services following any modification (and, if material, the applicable notification) constitutes your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the Terms of Use as modified. There may be additional terms and conditions if you use affiliate services, other Multiverse services or products, or third-party software and/or services.</p>

<p><b>2. DESCRIPTION OF SERVICE</b></p>

<p>Subject to full compliance with the Terms of Use, Multiverse may offer to provide certain services and content, as described more fully on the Site ("Services").  Services shall include, but not be limited to, any service or content available from one of our websites including  from any virtual worlds available in or through our Services (including, but not limited to text, user comments, messages, information, data, graphics, news articles, photographs, images, illustrations, software, audio clips and video clips, also collectively known as the "Content").  Multiverse may change, suspend or discontinue the Services including any Content for any reason, at any time, including the availability of any feature or part of the Content.  Multiverse may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Services without notice or liability.</p>

<p><b>3. YOUR REGISTRATION OBLIGATIONS</b></p>

<p>As a condition to using Services, you are required to register with Multiverse and select a password and account name ("Multiverse User ID"). You shall provide Multiverse with accurate, complete, and updated registration information.  Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of the Terms of Use, which may result in immediate termination of your Multiverse account. You may not (i) select or use as a Multiverse User ID a name of another person with the intent to impersonate that person; (ii) use as a Multiverse User ID a name subject to any rights of a person other than you without appropriate authorization; or (iii) use as a Multiverse User ID a name that is otherwise offensive, vulgar or obscene. Multiverse reserves the right to refuse registration of, or cancel a Multiverse User ID in its sole discretion.  You shall be responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your Multiverse password.</p>

<p>To register and receive Services you must be at least 18 years old, whether acting on your own behalf or as an authorized employee or representative of a corporation or other business entity. Further, you may only become a registered user if you live in a country or other political division that permits membership. If you do not so qualify, do not attempt to register for or use the Services.  This Agreement will be void and without effect, and you will not be entitled to any Services, if you do not satisfy these age and jurisdiction requirements.</p>

<p><b>4. USER CONDUCT</b></p>

<p>As a condition of use, you promise not to use the Services for any purpose that is unlawful or prohibited by these Terms of Use, or any other purpose not reasonably intended by Multiverse.</p>

<p>By way of example, and not as a limitation, you agree not to use the Services:</p>
<ol>
<li type=a>to abuse, harass, threaten, impersonate or intimidate other Multiverse users;  

<li type=a>to contribute any Content that is infringing, libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, offensive or otherwise violates any law or right of any third party;
<li type=a>for any illegal or unauthorized purpose (if you are an international user, you agree to comply with all local laws regarding online conduct and acceptable content);
<li type=a>to post or transmit, or cause to be posted or transmitted, any communication or solicitation designed or intended to obtain password, account, or private information from any Multiverse user;
<li type=a>to, except as expressly permitted by Multiverse, copy, modify, distribute, adapt or hack the Site, Services or any Content or to modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Site;
<li type=a>to create or submit unwanted email (“Spam”) to any other Multiverse user or any URL; 
<li type=a>to violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright laws);
<li type=a>to submit stories or comments linking to affiliate programs, multi-level marketing schemes, sites/blogs repurposing existing stories (source hops), or off-topic content;
<li type=a>to create separate user accounts with the intention of artificially inflating the “Multiverse count”, blog count, comments, or any other Multiverse metric or service;
<li type=a>after Multiverse has refused registration of, or canceled your Multiverse User ID, whether by attempting to register using a different Multiverse User ID or otherwise circumventing the account registration process;
<li type=a>to create a Multiverse User ID using “bots” or any other automated process, or to register a Multiverse User ID with the intention of preventing others from registering such Multiverse User ID;
<li type=a>to follow traditionally accepted rules governing contact between adults and minors (anyone under 18), including respect for privacy and restraints on language and behavior. Traditionally accepted rules prohibit improper overtures, sexually suggestive activity and prying questions in contact between adults and minors;
<li type=a>to impersonate any other person, including, but not limited to any Multiverse employee or other user of the Site or Services; or
<li type=a>to otherwise falsely claim to be authorized to act by or on behalf of Multiverse or other users of the Site or Services (e.g. a Multiverse Game Master).
</ol>

<p>You will not use any robot, spider, scraper or other automated means to access the Service for any purpose without Multiverse's express written permission.  Additionally, you agree that you will not: (i) take any action that imposes, or may impose in Multiverse's sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on Multiverse's infrastructure; (ii) interfere or attempt to interfere with the proper working of the Service or any activities conducted on the Service; or (iii) bypass any measures Multiverse may use to prevent or restrict access to the Service.</p>

<p>You shall not (and you shall not permit others to), directly or indirectly, modify, translate, decompile, disassemble, or reverse engineer any part of the Services or any content available through the Site (except to the limited extent applicable laws specifically prohibit such restriction); or copy, rent, lease, distribute, or otherwise transfer any or the rights that you receive hereunder.  In addition, you shall not remove any proprietary notices or labels.</p>

<p><b>You may not harvest or collect information, including screen names, about other members or users of the Services. The use of any information learned through the Services or while in the Site is limited to the express purposes set forth in these Terms of Use; all other uses, including, without limitation, sending unsolicited bulk e-mail, are strictly prohibited.</b></p>

<p>Multiverse may remove any Content and Multiverse Accounts at any time for any reason (including, but not limited to, upon receipt of claims or allegations from third parties or authorities relating to such Content), or for no reason at all.  To report Terms of Use abuse, please email:

<p><b>9. WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS</b></p> 

<p><u>Third Party Content.</u>  Much of the Content displayed in connection with the Service is developed by people over whom Multiverse exercises no control.  Accordingly, the Service may include (or direct you to sites or virtual worlds containing) Content that some people find objectionable, inappropriate, or offensive.  Multiverse cannot guarantee that your use of the Service will not expose you to unintended or objectionable Content and Multiverse assumes no responsibility for what effects the Content may have on you, how you may interpret or use the Content, or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content.  You hereby release Multiverse from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Service.  Multiverse makes no representations concerning any content contained in or accessed through the Service, and Multiverse will not be responsible or liable for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality or decency of material contained in or accessed through the Service.</p>

<p><u>General Disclaimer.</u>  THE SERVICE, CONTENT, AND SITE ARE PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT.  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON HOW LONG AN IMPLIED WARRANTY LASTS, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p><b>10.  LINKS</b></p>

The Services may provide, or third parties may provide, links to other World Wide Web sites, virtual worlds, or other resources.  Because Multiverse has no control over such sites, virtual worlds, and resources, you acknowledge and agree that Multiverse is not responsible for the availability of such external sites, virtual worlds, or resources, and does not endorse and is not responsible or liable for any Content, advertising, products or other materials on or available from such sites, virtual worlds, or resources.  You further acknowledge and agree that Multiverse shall not be responsible or liable, directly or indirectly, for any damage or loss caused or alleged to be caused by or in connection with use of or reliance on any such Content, goods or services available on or through any such site, virtual world, or resource.</p>

<p><b>11. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY</b></p>

<p>IN NO EVENT SHALL MULTIVERSE OR ITS SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE UNDER CONTRACT, TORT, STRICT LIABILITY, NEGLIGENCE OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY WITH RESPECT TO THE SITE, THE SERVICES OR ANY CONTENT (I) FOR ANY LOST PROFITS OR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES (HOWEVER ARISING), OR (II) FOR ANY DIRECT DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF (IN THE AGGREGATE) $10 (U.S.).  SOME STATES DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATIONS AND EXCLUSIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</p>

<p><b>12. TERMINATION</b></p>

<p>Multiverse may terminate or suspend any and all Services and your Multiverse account immediately, without prior notice or liability, if you breach any of the terms or conditions of the Terms of Use. Upon termination of your account, your right to use the Services will immediately cease. If you wish to terminate your Multiverse account, you may simply discontinue using the Services.  All provisions of the Terms of Use which by their nature should survive termination shall survive termination, including, without limitation, ownership provisions, warranty disclaimers, indemnity and limitations of liability.</p>

<p><b>13.  DEVELOPER ADDENDUM</b></p>

<p>If you are a developer, your use of the Site and the Services is also governed by the Developer Addendum, found at <a href="http://www.multiverse.net/about/developerterms.jsp?cid=6&scid=0">http://www.multiverse.net/about/developerterms.jsp</a>, that is a part of these Terms of Use and to which you are subject.</p>

<p><b>14.  MISCELLANEOUS</b></p>

<p>No agency, partnership, joint venture, or employment is created as a result of the Terms of Use and you do not have any authority of any kind to bind Multiverse in any respect whatsoever. The failure of either party to exercise in any respect any right provided for herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. Multiverse shall not be liable for any failure to perform its obligations hereunder where such failure results from any cause beyond Multiverse’s reasonable control, including, without limitation, mechanical, electronic or communications failure or degradation (including "line-noise" interference). </p>
<p>If any provision of the Terms of Use is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that the Terms of Use shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable. The Terms of Use is not assignable, transferable or sublicensable by you except with Multiverse's prior written consent. Multiverse may transfer, assign or delegate the Terms of Use and its rights and obligations without consent.  </p>
<p>The Terms of Use shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the state of California, as if made within California between two residents thereof, and the parties submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Superior Court of San Francisco County and the United States District Court for the Northern District of California.  Notwithstanding the foregoing sentence, (but without limiting Multiverse’s right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief in any court of competent jurisdiction), any disputes arising with respect to this Agreement shall be referred to an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS.  The arbitrator shall be selected by joint agreement of the parties.  In the event the parties cannot agree on an arbitrator within thirty (30) days of the initiating party providing the other party with written notice that it plans to seek arbitration, the parties shall each select an arbitrator affiliated with JAMS, which arbitrators shall jointly select a third such arbitrator to resolve the dispute.  The written decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties.  The arbitration proceeding shall be carried on and heard in San Francisco, California using the English language and pursuant to the rules of (and administered by) JAMS.  </p>
<p>In any action or proceeding to enforce rights under the Terms of Use, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover costs and attorneys' fees.  Both parties agree that the Terms of Use is the complete and exclusive statement of the mutual understanding of the parties and supersedes and cancels all previous written and oral agreements, communications and other understandings relating to the subject matter of the Terms of Use and that all modifications, except as otherwise provided herein, must be in a writing signed by both parties.</p>
